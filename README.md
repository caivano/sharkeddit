## Project - Labbedit
This project was developed at the third module of [Labenu's Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.labenu.com.br/).

**Scope:** It's a remake of Reddit and it's original name was Labeddit. To differentiate the name from colleagues' versions - and since I'm very fond of sharks - it became Sharkeddit.
